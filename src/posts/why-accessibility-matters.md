# Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility isn't just about following guidelinesâ€”it's about making sure everyone can use your website. Semantic HTML, proper contrast ratios, and keyboard navigation are all important considerations.

## Key Principles

1. **Semantic HTML**: Use the right elements for the right purpose
2. **Contrast Ratios**: Ensure text is readable against backgrounds
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality should be accessible via keyboard
4. **Screen Reader Support**: Test with screen readers

## Implementation

By building with accessibility in mind from the start, you create a better experience for all users, not just those who need assistive technologies.

## Testing

Regular testing with accessibility tools and real users helps identify issues early in the development process.
