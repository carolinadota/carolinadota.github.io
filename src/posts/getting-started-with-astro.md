# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build faster websites with less client-side javascript. In this post, I'll share my experience getting started with Astro and why I chose it for my personal website.

## Why Astro?

Astro's approach to shipping zero javascript by default makes it incredibly fast. You can still add interactive components when needed using your favorite framework, but the default is pure html and css.

## Getting Started

The setup process is straightforward:

1. Install Astro
2. Create your first page
3. Add components as needed
4. Build and deploy

## Conclusion

I'm really enjoying working with Astro so far. The developer experience is great, and the performance benefits are substantial.
