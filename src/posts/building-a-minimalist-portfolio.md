# Building a Minimalist Portfolio

When designing my personal website, I wanted something clean and minimal. No unnecessary animations, no bloated frameworks, just content that's easy to read and navigate.

## Design Principles

I chose a dark theme with simple typography and ample whitespace. The goal was to let the content speak for itself without distractions.

## Technical Choices

- Simple HTML and CSS
- No client-side JavaScript
- Focus on accessibility
- Fast load times

## Results

The final result is a website that loads instantly and is easy to navigate. Mission accomplished!
