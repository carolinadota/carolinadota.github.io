    <h2>getting started with astro</h2>
    <p><small>september 2025</small></p>
    <p>
      astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build faster websites 
      with less client-side javascript. in this post, i'll share my experience getting 
      started with astro and why i chose it for my personal website.
    </p>
    <p>
      astro's approach to shipping zero javascript by default makes it incredibly fast. 
      you can still add interactive components when needed using your favorite framework, 
      but the default is pure html and css.

    <h2>building a minimalist portfolio</h2>
    <p><small>august 2025</small></p>
    <p>
      when designing my personal website, i wanted something clean and minimal. 
      no unnecessary animations, no bloated frameworks, just content that's easy to read 
      and navigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      i chose a dark theme with simple typography and ample whitespace. the goal was to 
      let the content speak for itself without distractions.

    <h2>why accessibility matters</h2>
    <p><small>july 2025</small></p>
    <p>
      accessibility isn't just about following guidelinesâ€”it's about making sure everyone 
      can use your website. semantic html, proper contrast ratios, and keyboard navigation 
      are all important considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      by building with accessibility in mind from the start, you create a better experience 
      for all users, not just those who need assistive technologies.
