    answers to some common questions about me
  </p>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>Why is your name Carolina Dota?</h2>
    <p>
      Back in 2014, I was playing video games on my computer and my username was South Carolina because I liked the flag and lived there.
      I shortened it to Carolina because I wanted a female avatar.
      Been that way since then.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>What do you do for a living?</h2>
    <p>
      I have a background in Healthcare IT but I don't work at the moment.
      I am going back to school full time for a bachelor's degree in microbiology.
      What I do spend my time in is building websites and applications.
      I also spend a lot of time doing nothing because I am a neet at the moment.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>Why are you transitioning genders?</h2>
    <p>
      Why not? It's a personal choice and I am happy with it. I would rather present myself as feminine than masculine. 
      I will write a longer blog post about it later becuase my thoughts are not fully formed yet.
