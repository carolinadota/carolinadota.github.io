    <h2>what's your development process like?</h2>
    <p>
      i believe in starting with a clear understanding of the problem and the users' needs.

      development, i prioritize clean, maintainable code and thorough testing.

    <h2>how did you get into web development?</h2>
    <p>
      i've always been fascinated by the intersection of design and technology. web development 
      allows me to combine creative problem-solving with technical skills, which is incredibly 
      rewarding. i started learning through online resources and personal projects, and i've 
      been hooked ever since.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>what tools do you use daily?</h2>
    <p>
      my main tools include vscode for coding, git for version control, and various testing 
      frameworks depending on the project. i also use figma for design work and notion for 
      project planning and documentation.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>do you have any advice for aspiring developers?</h2>
    <p>
      start building things as soon as possible. don't wait until you feel "ready"â€”you learn 
      the most by doing. also, focus on understanding fundamentals rather than just following 
      tutorials. and don't forget to engage with the developer community; there's so much to 
      learn from others.
    </p>
